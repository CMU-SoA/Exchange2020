The studio focused on how to evaluate an architectural idea(s) through analysis, representation and application. The semester started with a series of projects that introduced the timeless compositional methods that architects consider when designing a memorable piece of architecture. These themes are not necessarily answers on what to do, but are ways for a designer to start a career in architecture including how to work within it, how to build upon it, and how to critically appreciate the architectural works one is introduced to.  \n\nOur advice to the young architect is to be curious, be humble, and to work hard."},{title:"DIGITAL MEDIA I & II 2018-2019",instructors:"Eddy Man Kim,  \n\nDM I TAs: Mariana Alberola, Cathy Dong, Ryu Kondrup, Sophie Lee, Nicole LeePark, Sam Losi, Isabella Ouyang, Jinmo Rhee, Yingying Yan,  \n\nDM II TAs:Cathy Dong, Ryu Kondrup, Sophie Lee, Sam Losi, Isabella Ouyang, Jinmo Rhee, Yingying Yan",description:"Digital Media I offers an overview of foundational workflows in digital media regarding two-dimensional representation techniques for spatial design processes.

With digital media, designers now have an arsenal of tools that can subvert and augment traditional means of representation with exponentially greater fidelity and efficiency. Students will have an opportunity to practice these values and favor hybrid approaches that strive to blur the boundaries of analog and digital media, so as to learn how to be versatile in leveraging all forms of media for the design task at hand.\n\nDigital Media II will build on these concepts and focus on 3D modeling and visualization.

Grow Collective encourages students to consider how architecture participates in the interrelated ecological, infrastructural, and social systems in our cities today. The studio explores the relationship between thinking and doing and is divided into three projects framed by four guiding themes: Enclosure, Systems, Making, and Collaboration.  \n\nThe second project of the studio asks students to leverage architectural design to advocate for new modes of food growth, distribution, and education in Pittsburgh neighborhoods through the design of The Grow Collective Center for Urban Agriculture, a new piece of public infrastructure that serves as a hub supporting urban gardening and farming activity in Pittsburgh.

Environment, Form and Feedback is a core design studio focused on architectures for extreme urban environments. Considering projections of rising waters and extreme weather events, Six Mile Island becomes a testing ground for new forms and infrastructures in a perpetual flooding landscape. By engaging social and environmental patterns and identifying microclimatic behaviors using environmental simulation and drawing, we move towards the design of architectural interventions that translate across scales to give new shape to the contemporary city. Ecology posits that all entities in thermodynamic relationships with one another are bound together in complex systems of energy and information exchange: ecosystems. This studio focuses on design within a specific urban ecology while introducing performative considerations such as energy processing and climate responsiveness into the early stages of the design process. Initially, the studio focuses on understanding the larger ecology of the site, followed by a careful development of architectural organizations and their aggregation at the urban scale.

The Advanced Construction Studio at Carnegie Mellon University is concerned with the detailed development and refinement of architectural design as informed by the integration of structural, enclosure, environmental, and material systems and the process of construction. The student is expected to comprehensively articulate concepts and develop designs with more precision and in greater detail than done in previous studios and courses.  \n\nTo enable students in this studio to achieve the ambitious learning objectives, the model of a studio coordinator, a studio consultant, individual studio instructors and a concurrent lecture/workshop series has been implemented. The studio coordinator and consultant assist the students with the application and synthesis of the knowledge from pre-requisite studios and technology courses through pin-ups and board crits. They will be available for design reviews on a weekly basis. The program for the semester-long project will be the same for all students to encourage dialogue and to maximize learning opportunities from observing multiple approaches to design. The sites for the design proposals will be different for each studio to increase the number of contexts to which the students are familiar and to learn the influence of context on design decision making.The work in this studio also includes a class-wide sketch problem.
