This course will act an introduction to a variety of modes of thinking, methods of work and scales of operation. The purpose will be to begin to develop acritical practice which considers materiality, virtuality, time and space. The studio will be rhizomic, it will form two interlocking groupings in order to expand the intellectual and creative cross connections. In this way the studio as a whole will develop its own language and share a set of discoveries both conceptual and material.  

The parallel courses “Architecture in the Arts,” “Digital Media,” and “Analogue Media” are integrated with studio and each contribute towards the intellectual framework of the semester. Wood shop skills will be acquired in studio time in shop sessions.  

The focus for the studio will be Carrie Furnace, Rankin, PA which will act as inspiration, prompt and design location for all the three assignments. Each project has a different time register, scale and primary model material. All projects will use the lens of time and forces of spatial transformation.`

The study of architecture is a complicated one. What is architecture? If you asked any number of architects, each response would be different and all equally appropriate. Why are the responses so different? That’s a long and complicated discussion and one that will take a lifetime to understand if you are committed to mastering the what we believe is the “presence” of architecture.  

The spring semester was about developing an architectural instinct. The studio focused on how to evaluate an architectural idea(s) through analysis, representation and application. The semester started with a series of projects that introduced the timeless compositional methods that architects consider when designing a memorable piece of architecture. These themes are not necessarily answers on what to do, but are ways for a designer to start a career in architecture including how to work within it, how to build upon it, and how to critically appreciate the architectural works one is introduced to.  

Our advice to the young architect is to be curious, be humble, and to work hard.`

The course is divided into two topics with one assignment each: Technical Drawing and 2D Graphics. The course will inquire issues of 2D representation as it pertains to the effective communication of technical and conceptual information in spatial design processes. With digital media, designers now have an arsenal of tools that can subvert and augment traditional means of representation with exponentially greater fidelity and efficiency. Students will have an opportunity to practice these values and favor hybrid approaches that strive to blur the boundaries of analog and digital media, so as to learn how to be versatile in leveraging all forms of media for the design task at hand.

Digital Media II will build on these concepts and focus on 3D modeling and visualization. Students will embark on an in-depth training and exploration of performative geometry and its attributes as they pertain to computational communication of spatial conditions. The sequence of assignments will cover topics of basic, advanced, and generative 3D modeling.`

Exercises are inspired by the approach of Kimon Nicolaides, The Natural Way to Draw, to these same subjects. The second focuses on the projection of space using both freehand axonometric and perspective drawing. The third is centered on modeling surface and creating space by using tone. A sculptural approach adapted from Kimon Nicolaides is used and at the end applied to drawing architectural sections.  

“Drawing and Appearance” is a traditional course in free-hand architectural drawing.

Grow Collective encourages students to consider how architecture participates in the interrelated ecological, infrastructural, and social systems in our cities today. The studio explores the relationship between thinking and doing and is divided into three projects framed by four guiding themes: Enclosure, Systems, Making, and Collaboration.  

The second project of the studio asks students to leverage architectural design to advocate for new modes of food growth, distribution, and education in Pittsburgh neighborhoods through the design of The Grow Collective Center for Urban Agriculture, a new piece of public infrastructure that serves as a hub supporting urban gardening and farming activity in Pittsburgh. Students work within an array of constraints, material affordance, and client preferences to move beyond mere problem solving and consider how building and landscape can interact and actively participate in shaping the future of an urban neighborhood.`

This studio explores the relationship between thinking and doing. The studio relies upon curiosity, critical thinking, and discourse to explore how a materially sensitive design process elevates one’s understanding of architecture and the environment. It leverages design techniques that address questions of perception, material presence, and the elemental conditions of architecture.  

While materiality and novel fabrication techniques serve as the centerpiece of much contemporary architecture, great architecture throughout history has relied upon material presence to heighten one’s awareness of their surroundings and transform the everyday into the spectacular. As part of the core studio sequence, this studio builds upon the content of previous studios and seeks to impart students with a working methodology engaged in the material reality of architecture as lived in and felt space. As such, the lessons from previous studios related to conceptual, technical, urban and societal issues will be relied upon to promote a holistic understanding of the design process in which multiple factors are simultaneously in play and interdependent.  

Through a rigorous process of modeling and prototyping, students interrogate and explore architecture’s form, material, and structure in service to a material gestalt in which the sum is greater than its

Environment, Form and Feedback is a core design studio focused on architectures for extreme urban environments. Considering projections of rising waters and extreme weather events, Six Mile Island becomes a testing ground for new forms and infrastructures in a perpetual flooding landscape. By engaging social and environmental patterns and identifying microclimatic behaviors using environmental simulation and drawing, we move towards the design of architectural interventions that translate across scales to give new shape to the contemporary city. Ecology posits that all entities in thermodynamic relationships with one another are bound together in complex systems of energy and information exchange: ecosystems. This studio focuses on design within a specific urban ecology while introducing performative considerations such as energy processing and climate responsiveness into the early stages of the design process. Initially, the studio focuses on understanding the larger ecology of the site, followed by a careful development of architectural organizations and their aggregation at the urban scale. Students learn to negotiate spatial relationships between the water infrastructure and a proposed architectural tectonics.

The student is expected to comprehensively articulate concepts and develop designs with more precision and in greater detail than done in previous studios and courses.  

To enable students in this studio to achieve the ambitious learning objectives, the model of a studio coordinator, a studio consultant, individual studio instructors and a concurrent lecture/workshop series has been implemented. The studio coordinator and consultant assist the students with the application and synthesis of the knowledge from pre-requisite studios and technology courses through pin-ups and board crits. They will be available for design reviews on a weekly basis. The program for the semester-long project will be the same for all students to encourage dialogue and to maximize learning opportunities from observing multiple approaches to design. The sites for the design proposals will be different for each studio to increase the number of contexts to which the students are familiar and to learn the influence of context on design decision making.The work in this studio also includes a class-wide sketch problem. The sketch problem is designed to have students rapidly consider all of the issues to be covered by the studio, to learn to interpret solutions from analysis of source material and to learn to generate—represent—evaluate—design alternatives.`

Wood is arguably architecture’s original additive
material. Epitomized through Laugier’s myth of the
primitive hut in which trunk became column and branch
became beam, the birth of architecture beyond the cave
is inextricably tied to the tree. Despite the virtues of
this abundant and replenishable material, modernism
largely passed by wood in pursuit of the promise of steel
and concrete to usher in a radical new global style of
architecture. While the stylistic ambitions of modernism
were undercut by an era of iconic building, modernism’s
primary materials of concrete and steel continue to
serve as the basis for large-scale construction across
the globe.

In putting forth a material-centric agenda, this studio
seeks to explore what it might mean to build with
wood at larger scale in the city and how this method
of construction might establish novel architectural
scenarios. This studio aims to challenge notions of
permanence to consider architecture’s presence
through time. The studio is interested in not only
the spatial-structural affordances of timber but also
the psychological potential of wood environments
and perceived notions of “natural” materials. In
foregrounding structural-material conditions, the studio
aims to extend contemporary material discourse from
architecture’s skin to its bones.`

This studio focused on the role of the architectural
promenade and how it can be adapted to the typology
of the high-rise. The promenade architecturale first
described by Le Corbusier as a sequence of spaces
and direction of movement in the Acropolis in Athens
is a way of constructing views, vistas and experiences.
The high-rise, an American typology, acknowledges
maximizing building area but does not address the
role of the architectural sequence. The studio will
investigated the high-rise typology through the
hybridization of the typology with the architectural
promenade.

Located in SoHo, New York City this mixed use highrise project (Museum Annex and Residential Units) is
located directly across from the Judd Foundation. Often
considered an artist of obdurate space, Judd’s works
are highly refined being conscious of their context
(what he called fundamental realities), space,
material, color and detail. An inspiration to architects
such as Steven Holl and Herzog & de Meuron,
the works of minimalist artist Donald Judd (1928-
1994) spanned both art and architecture through a
search for autonomy and clarity for the objects and the
spaces they occupy. The studio focused on the writings
and artistic output of Donald Judd as the intellectual
underpinning of the studio, this informed the spatial

architecture from building.  
The studio will investigate a few of the issues raised
by the Venice Biennale 16th International Architecture
Exhibition, FREESPACE. This year’s curators, Yvonne
Farrell and Shelley McNamara, conceived an exhibition
that presents “examples, proposals, elements—built
or unbuilt—of work that exemplifies essential qualities
of architecture … revealing [its] embodied power
and beauty”. We will consider the following questions
raised by this edition: What is the “embodied power” of
architecture? What responsibility do we as architects
have as stewards of the built environment and towards
our fellow humans? How does the architects’ skill in the
making of space create the conditions for an enduring
exchange between user and building? How can we add
value to projects in ways that allow them to exceed
expectations? Is it enough to satisfy the needs of the
client? We will bring these questions to bear on our

requiring students to develop mastery of the technical
realities of performance productions, construction
methodologies, structural & mechanical systems and
community/stakeholder activism. Students will meet
with the real client, potential users, public officials and
the professional design team involved in the project,
learning to analyze and understand the needs of these
distinct occupant groups and use those needs as the
fundamental basis of concept ideation. Design is also
informed and shaped by the cultural significance and

        description: `Birth Rights: Connecting the Built Environment to
Maternal and Infant Care in Vulnerable Populations in
Pittsburgh  
The maternal mortality rate in the United States is
increasing; the U.S. is one of only 13 countries to have
more maternal deaths today than 25 years ago. Black
women are three to four times more likely to die in
childbirth or in the first year after than their white
counterparts. Black infants are twice as likely to die
as white infants (CDC, 2016). How can we envision a
more holistic approach to mother and infant care that
accounts for racial, socioeconomic, access, and age
disparities in communities around Pittsburgh?

Working with members of the Pittsburgh birth
community, this studio will seek to understand the
challenges and opportunities that arise from exploring
systems in place at a variety of scales within the
realm of women’s health, and how innovative built
environments could rethink or restructure those
systems to achieve better outcomes for vulnerable
populations. How can architecture become part of the
narrative that helps women and their babies survive into
motherhood? How can architecture support vulnerable
populations through prenatal, birth, and postpartum
stages of parenthood? How can architecture empower
women to be advocates for themselves and their
babies?`

The Urban Design Studio II introduces design methods
and processes for working with larger and holistic
urban systems, inter-disciplinary agencies, and
organizations as basic design components and how
they are integrated to create place as well as vision. The
studio uses design tools that are analytic and modelingbased, including geo-locational and building modeling
softwares; systems methodologies and processes;
sustainability through triple bottom-line and other
indicators; and design evaluation using performance
measurements.Working with Friends of the Riverfront
(FOR), a non-profit organization responsible for the
development and stewardship of Pittsburgh’s 24-mile
Three Rivers Heritage Trail, the studio will develop an
overall vision for the second generation of Heritage
Trail improvements using the Chateau neighborhood as
its case study.  
Pittsburgh’s riverfronts are a regional asset and FOR
embraces the idea that the Heritage Trail should be
an environmental, economic, and social generator for
its long-term sustainability. FOR has asked the studio
to help them build the design case to attract the
investment needed to make this a reality. Missing are
basic features, such as comfort stations, good access,
restaurants, and other place-based amenities that
would draw citizens and visitors alike to the trail system.
The studio will be developing design ideas, guidelines,
and performance measures for Friends of the Riverfront
to take forward as the Three Rivers Heritage Trail’s
public steward and advocate.`

        description: `Commoning the City: Urban Collaboratory Studio  
This two semester research-based-design studio is
focused on the bottom-up transformation of cities
and explores how designers and planners can tap
into the self-organizaing behavior of cities in order
to empower citizens to claim their right to the city.
The first semester, taught by Stefan Gruber, will focus
on collective case study research that leads to the
development of an individual design thesis proposal.

The second semester, taught by Jonathan Kline, will
support students in developing their individual thesis
projects culminating in an exhibition at the Miller
Gallery. While required for all second year Master of
Urban Design students, the studio offers MArch and
ASOS students an opportunity to pursue a year long
thesis within a structured research environment. In the
Fall the studio will do a mid-semester research trip to
Zurich, Switzerland.

The commons are emerging as a key concept beyond
the binaries of public and private space for tackling
the challenges of the contemporary metropolis: How
to build urban resilience in the face of dwindelling
resources? How to tackle growing inequity in the face
of polarizing politics? How to articulate common
interests despite increasing social individualization?
And how to find agency as architects given the scope
of these challenges? Here commons are understood
as a set of practices dealing with the production
and self-management of collective resourcees and spaces beyond contemporary forms of domination
(such as class, gender or race). Throughout the
2018/19. academic year the studio will continue a
collaboration with ARCH+ and ifa, contributing to
the travelling exhibition An Atlas of Commoning and
its accompanying publication. Our research will be
featured in the international premiere of the exhibition
in Pittsburgh in the summer of 2019.

FALL: RESEARCH-BASED DESIGN
The Fall studio will develop the core Atlas, by
researching and assembling both international and
Pittsburgh region cases that critically explore practices
of urban commoning, and embed them in a broader
context of societal transitions. Learning from the
collective research, students will then develop a
hypothesis and begin testing the aquired know-how in
an urban milieu of their choice.

SPRING: DESIGN-BASED RESEARCH
The Spring studio will focus on developing individual
thesis and design proposals exploring the theme of
urban commoning. For the project students will be
expected to take a personal position and formulate a
thesis, expressed and refi ned through design. The site,
program and general parameters of the project will be
determined during the fall, allowing students to gather
data and base materials over the winter break. The
projects will be featured in the thesis exhibition at the
Miller ICA.`

human-centered and the technical. For the first half
of the semester students are introduced to the idea of
responsive mobile environments and will tour the three
facets of intelligent spaces through readings, applied
explorations and guest lecturers. The second half of the
semester is organized around large scale and applied
collaborative projects. Students apply their knowledge
by working in teams to prototype a responsive

within it. Students together take an interdisciplinary
approach to integrate technical and aesthetic
frameworks for sensing, analysis, and feedback of
human activity in intelligent and augmented spaces. `

The program focuses on the creation of new insights and new knowledge—or “research”—through the design process, or “research by design.” The program seeks to probe the technical and cultural opportunities and implications of a data-rich future in which design methodologies, construction processes, and sustainable building life cycles are intrinsically interlaced. The goal is consciously speculative and experimental work that is deeply enmeshed with social and environmental concerns, with explicit ties to humanistic and cultural discourses, industry, and contemporary practice.
