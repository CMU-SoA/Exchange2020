What is architecture? If you asked any number of architects, each response would be different and all equally appropriate. Why are the responses so different? That’s a long and complicated discussion and one that will take a lifetime to understand if you are committed to mastering the what we believe is the “presence” of architecture.  \n\nThe spring semester was about developing an architectural instinct. The studio focused on how to evaluate an architectural idea(s) through analysis, representation and application. The semester started with a series of projects that introduced the timeless compositional methods that architects consider when designing a memorable piece of architecture. These themes are not necessarily answers on what to do, but are ways for a designer to start a career in architecture including how to work within it, how to build upon it, and how to critically appreciate the architectural works one is introduced to.  \n\nOur advice to the young architect is to be curious, be humble, and to work hard.`\n    },\n    {\n        title: `DIGITAL MEDIA I & II 2018-2019`,\n        instructors: `Eddy Man Kim,  \n\nDM I TAs: Mariana Alberola, Cathy Dong, Ryu Kondrup, Sophie Lee, Nicole LeePark, Sam Losi, Isabella Ouyang, Jinmo Rhee, Yingying Yan,  \n\nDM II TAs:Cathy Dong, Ryu Kondrup, Sophie Lee, Sam Losi, Isabella Ouyang, Jinmo Rhee, Yingying Yan`,\n\n        description: `Digital Media I offers an overview of foundational workflows in digital media regarding two-dimensional representation techniques for spatial design processes. The course is divided into two topics with one assignment each: Technical Drawing and 2D Graphics. The course will inquire issues of 2D representation as it pertains to the effective communication of technical and conceptual information in spatial design processes. With digital media, designers now have an arsenal of tools that can subvert and augment traditional means of representation with exponentially greater fidelity and efficiency. Students will have an opportunity to practice these values and favor hybrid approaches that strive to blur the boundaries of analog and digital media, so as to learn how to be versatile in leveraging all forms of media for the design task at hand.\n\nDigital Media II will build on these concepts and focus on 3D modeling and visualization. Students will embark on an in-depth training and exploration of performative geometry and its attributes as they pertain to computational communication of spatial conditions.

The program mobilizes Carnegie Mellon University’s computational strengths to enable students to explore technical and cultural aspects of computation as it relates to architecture, design, and the built environment. In spheres ranging from the applied to the speculative, and from the poetic to the critical, students in the program conduct research on subjects such as artificial intelligence, architectural robotics, digital fabrication, simulation, computational geometry, responsive environments, and shape grammars—as well as on embodied and tangible forms of design interaction, fabrication, and expression. A research program, the MSCD adopts a broad view of design technologies as vehicles of design inquiry, as speculative artifacts, and as worthy subjects of critical analysis and debate. The program is well suited to highly inquisitive applicants who are interested in challenging disciplinary boundaries, developing a unique research agenda, and acquiring the conceptual and technical skills to conduct computational design research at the highest levels of scholarly rigor and creativity. `}, {title: `ADVANCED ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN`, instructors: `Jeremy Ficca`, description: `The Master of Advanced Architectural Design (MAAD) is a post-graduate, studio-based program that engages emerging methods of design and fabrication through architectural design to speculate upon future modes of architectural practice, enhanced construction methods, and material culture within the built environment. With a particular emphasis upon design, the foursemester program leverages the SoA’s core strengths in design fabrication, architectural robotics, computational design, and ecological thinking as vehicles for knowledge acquisition and speculation. The program focuses on the creation of new insights and new knowledge—or “research”—through the design process, or “research by design.” The program seeks to probe the technical and cultural opportunities and implications of a data-rich future in which design methodologies, construction processes, and sustainable building life cycles are intrinsically interlaced. The goal is consciously speculative and experimental work that is deeply enmeshed with social and environmental concerns, with explicit ties to humanistic and cultural discourses, industry, and contemporary practice.
