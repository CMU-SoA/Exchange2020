<p>Emerging from conversations about memory and nostalgia, this website was designed with some relatively old school tech and visuals. Early in developing the virtual exhibit, scouring the internet for websites that displayed work thoughtfully, but also playfully, the <a href="https://wolfmanmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Wolfman Museum of Art</a> stood out as a precedent. Early video games (like the early '90s classic, Myst) were also models of inspiration as we developed our graphic language, modes of navigation, and world-building more generally. We were less interested in purely cataloging work or reproducing of our physical institution on a screen, instead excited by the opportunity to create a reflection of these spaces we knew intimately, yet found ourselves separated from: to ask how the work fit together, stitched together our community, and to what it meant for the work to come from that remembered place.</p>
<p>It is very image-heavy (necessarily, to display hundreds of visually-heavy projects), and is best viewed with internet running at a decent clip to load and view them all. Due to the format of most of the perspective scenes, we also recommend viewing in landscape (wide) mode, especially on smaller screens. While a mouse isn't necessary, it does expand your opportunity for discovery.</p>
<p>Most of the image navigation on this site works like point and click video games: Follow the arrows, but also look for hidden routes and animations. The elevator (and stairs if you can find them) move you between floors. If you get lost, try visiting the <a href="map.html">map</a> page.</p>
<p>Clicking on the work within the perspective views should bring you to an undistorted middle view of that portion of the gallery, and further clicks will get you to a full-sized reproduction of the work, along with attribution information.</p>
